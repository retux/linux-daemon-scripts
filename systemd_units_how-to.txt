Writing unit files
------------------

     /usr/lib/systemd/system/ ---> units provided by installed packages
     /etc/systemd/system/     ---> units installed by the system administrator


Handling dependencies
---------------------

Suppose you are working with unit A but it requires unit B to be running before (B is a dependency of A) you can specify dependencies into the [Unit] section with:

Requires=B
After=B

Dependencies are typically placed on services and not on targets. For example, network.target is pulled in by whatever service configures your network interfaces, therefore ordering your custom unit after it is sufficient since network.target is started anyway.


Service types
-------------

There are several different start-up types to consider when writing a custom service file. This is set with the Type= parameter in the [Service] section:

    Type=simple (default): systemd considers the service to be started up immediately. The process must not fork. Do not use this type if other services need to be ordered on this service, unless it is socket activated.

    Type=forking: systemd considers the service started up once the process forks and the parent has exited. For classic daemons use this type unless you know that it is not necessary. You should specify PIDFile= as well so systemd can keep track of the main process.

    Type=oneshot: this is useful for scripts that do a single job and then exit. You may want to set RemainAfterExit=yes as well so that systemd still considers the service as active after the process has exited.

    Type=notify: identical to Type=simple, but with the stipulation that the daemon will send a signal to systemd when it is ready. The reference implementation for this notification is provided by libsystemd-daemon.so.

    Type=dbus: the service is considered ready when the specified BusName appears on DBus's system bus.

    Type=idle: systemd will delay execution of the service binary until all jobs are dispatched. Other than that behavior is very similar to Type=simple. 

unit file example
-----------------


[Unit]
Description=ATD daemon

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/atd

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
